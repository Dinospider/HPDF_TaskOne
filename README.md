# Hasura Product Development Fellowship (HPDF)
HPDF - Task One

Project based on Python - Flask framework. Purpose of the project is to learn and execute basic back-end functionalities.

__init__.py       : Main file containing routes to web application

Templates folder  : Contains all html files used for the webapp

To start, clone the repo and setup flask (if necessary).  
How to: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/

Then run 'python __init__.py' from a flask environment.
The webapp should then run on the machine.

The web pages accessible are:

->http://localhost:5000/ : Hello World

->http://localhost:5000/authors : Responds with a list of authors and their posts

->http://localhost:5000/setcookie : Sets two cookies, name and age, given by user

->http://localhost:5000/getcookies : Gets the cookies

->http://localhost:5000/robots.txt : Denies access to user

->http://localhost:5000/html : Renders a HTML page

->http://localhost:5000/input : Receives input from user and logs it to console  


Note: http://localhost:5000/ is just a sample, it may run on any other port.
